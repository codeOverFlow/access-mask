# AccessMask
AccessMask is a command line tool that interprets handle access mask values (both generic and specific).

**It is directly taken from the awesome tools from the one and only (the GOAT) [Pavel Yosifovich](https://github.com/zodiacon/AccessMask).**

This project is more or less a one-to-one rust translation of his tools but rust powered.

My primary goal is to learn more about windows internals by reading ~~God~~ Pavel's  code, and then to make it available through `cargo install`.

## Usage
```text
Usage: access-mask.exe [OPTIONS] <VALUE>
